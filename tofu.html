    <h2>Marinated tofu is extremely versatile. <br>
 Add it to a stir fry, salad, noodle bowl, sandwiches and so much more!</h2>
 <p>The best way to prevent your fried tofu from sticking to the bottom of the pan<br>
    is to preheat the oiled skillet and not move the tofu cubes AT ALL for the first 3 to 4 minutes.
    <br>This helps the bottom get nice and crispy, making the pieces much easier to flip. 
    <br>Be very gentle when you do eventually move them around in the pan and use a quality spatula.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>14.5 ounce block extra-firm tofu</li>
<li>4 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
<li>3 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger OR 1/2 teaspoon dried ginger</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Quick press the tofu: Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them evenly on a flat surface such as a cutting board lined with paper towels or a clean towel. Cover with a layer of paper towels, set a baking sheet on top and then something heavy, like a large book or cast iron skillet. Press like this for 15 minutes while you make the marinade.          </li>
    <li>Make the marinade: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, sesame oil, garlic and ginger.          </li>
    <li>Marinate the tofu: Place the pressed tofu pieces in a shallow dish. (In the photos above I doubled the recipe, so I used a 9 x 13 inch dish, but for one batch you will need a smaller dish, such as an 8 x 8 inch.) Pour the marinade over the tofu. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour, covered, in the refrigerator. If you want to leave it overnight, it will be even more flavorful.        </li>
    <li>Cook the tofu: In a large skillet, cast iron preferred, add a few tablespoons of a neutral oil, such as canola oil and heat over medium-high heat. You can omit the oil if needed, but you will need a very good non-stick pan so the tofu pieces donâ€™t stick. Remove the tofu pieces from the marinade and add to the pan. Do not discard the marinade sauce. Fry the tofu until golden brown on each side.        </li>
    <li>Once the tofu pieces are browned, pour any leftover marinade sauce into the pan with the tofu, and stir to coat. This makes the tofu even more flavorful! The tofu will quickly absorb the sauce. Remove from heat, and serve with rice and stir fried vegetables such as baby bok choy, mushrooms and carrots.</li>
